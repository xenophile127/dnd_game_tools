# Underscore ('_') is used to represent a space.
# This allows saving one sprite.
# Otherwise "habitantes" would encode as three sprites (4,4,2).
# And "enloquecieron" would encode as four sprites (4,4,4,1).
# Together as "habitantes_enloquecieron" they can be encoded as only six sprites (4,4,4,4,4,4).
#
# The same thing could be done with "tu grupo". This encodes as three sprites (2,4,1),
# but "tu_grupo" would encode as two (4,4).
#
# sprites.py could be smart about doing this (and about substring reuse) but doing it this way was simpler.
